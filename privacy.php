                                    In order for us to provide the Services to you, we may ask that you (i) provide us with log-in credentials to your Provider accounts so that we can access and use your Provider account information as described in this Policy and/or (ii) provide us with your email credentials so that we may access the emails a Provider sends to such email account and use such email content as described in this Policy. If you do not consent to our access to these accounts or these credentials, please do not use the Services. Such credentials may be subject to unauthorized access and use despite Eworxs’s use of reasonable security measures, as no security measures are 100% effective.Eworxs recommends that you do not provide Eworxs with log-in credentials for any email account that you use for purposes other than your Provider relationships.

There are many free services (such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail) through which you may create an e-mail account that you use only for purposes of your Provider relationships and your use of the Services.

                                    (a) Submitted Information. As part of using the Services, you may submit certain information to us. For example, when you register for an account on the Services we will collect information from you, including Personal Information such as your first and last name, phone number, a photo that you upload and an email address. “Personal Information” means information such as a name or email address that we can directly associate with a specific person or entity without additional information. To the extent you decline to share certain information with us, we may not be able to provide some or all of the features and functionalities found on the Services.
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="mb-0 text-muted" style="margin-bottom:20px;margin-top:20px;">
                                    (b) Provider Data. To provide you with the Services, we will use the log-in credentials you provide to review the contents of emails in your email accounts relating to your activities and transactions with Providers as well as information available through your Provider accounts relating to activities and transactions with that Provider. By way of example only, this information may include the number of miles driven over a given time, the amount of payments received from the Provider per task, or the number of times you worked with that Provider over a given period. We may analyze this information to come up with meaningful analysis of this data, such as the average amount of money earned per trip for the Provider or which times engaging for the Provider gives you the most payment.
                                 </p>

                                    (c) Automatically Collected Information. When you use the Services, we gather certain non-personally identifiable information from you, and this information can be associated with your user account. This includes usage information, such as information on when, how often and for how long you use the Online Service, as well as server log data such as a computer’s IP address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Online Service.

                                    (d) Tracking and Cookies. The Services may use both web beacons and cookies to collect information. “Beacons” (also often referred to as “pixels”) are tiny graphics on a web page designed to track when a page is viewed. “Cookies” are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that are downloaded by your web browser or mobile device when you visit a website. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies when you access and use the Services. Cookies may be used, for example, to remember your user account information and your preferences, to customize the interface of the Services for you and to assist us in measuring and analyzing Service traffic. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your browser’s documentation to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings. Like many websites, the Services does not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers. However, you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your computer’s hard drive and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored.
                                 </p>

These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, we use Google Analytics to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed in this Policy. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
